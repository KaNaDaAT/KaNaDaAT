  General Kenobi! You've stumbled upon my coding galaxy. <br>
  Don't worry, no Sith code here, just a bunch of C#, Nerdiness, and a sprinkle of the Force. 🌌✨

By now I had the chance to gain experience with a wide array of technologies. Currently, my primary focus is on C#, .NET, databases, and exploring game design as a hobby.

## My Coding Journey 🚀

I got into coding because of my love for Minecraft. I used to spend hours building crazy stuff with Redstone, and that got me curious about the tech side of things. So, I ended up at a computer tech school where I dived into coding, mainly with Java. That's when game development caught my eye, and I started creating small games using Unity and C#. They weren't super fancy, but I was proud of them.

School introduced me to various tools and languages, but C# really clicked with me. After graduation, I jumped into an information technology bachelor's program, and now, I'm cruising through the fifth semester – almost there! Professionally, I'm knee-deep in the .NET world, working on cool projects. On the side, I'm still doing my game development thing or woking on smaller projects because, well, it's just too much fun to give up!
