  Hello There

  General Kenobi! You've stumbled upon my coding galaxy. <br>
  Don't worry, no Sith code here, just a bunch of C#, Nerdiness, and a sprinkle of the Force. 🌌✨

## Skills 🛠️

Here are the tools and programming languages I have worked with so far:

By now I had the chance to gain experience with a wide array of technologies. Currently, my primary focus is on C#, .NET, databases, and exploring game design as a hobby.

Through crafting a custom engine, I deepened my understanding of **WebGL**. Furthermore, projects like my bachelor thesis ([Vega WebGPU renderer](https://github.com/KaNaDaAT/vega-webgpu)) acquainted me with **WebGPU**'s capabilities and applications. Excited to further explore these technologies in my upcoming master's thesis.

## My Coding Journey 🚀

I got into coding because of my love for Minecraft. I used to spend hours building crazy stuff with Redstone, and that got me curious about the tech side of things. So, I ended up at a computer tech school where I dived into coding, mainly with Java. That's when game development caught my eye, and I started creating small games using Unity and C#. They weren't super fancy, but I was proud of them.

Having graduated from an IT school in Vienna in 2021, I found my passion for C# among the array of tools and languages I encountered. In October 2021, I transitioned into an information technology bachelor's program, which I completed in February 2024. Now, I'm continuing my master's journey since March 2024, currently already in my 4th semester and working on my master’s thesis as part of the Vienna WebGPU Engine Project — a C++ [render engine](https://github.com/hlavacs/Vienna-WebGPU-Engine) built with WebGPU, focused on learning, clean architecture, and real-time rendering. 

Professionally, I'm knee-deep in the .NET world, working on cool projects. On the side, I'm still doing my game development thing or working on my own engine and smaller projects because, well, it's just too much fun to give up!
